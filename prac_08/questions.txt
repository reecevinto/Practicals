Lists Warmups

Part 1
Using the list numbers = [10, 20, 40, 81], predict and verify:

numbers[0]: 10
numbers[-1]: 81
numbers[3]: 81
20 in numbers: True
1 in numbers: False
numbers[1] + numbers[2]: 60
len(numbers): 4

Part 2
Predict the results of modifying and querying numbers:

Change the first element: numbers[0] = 1
Change the last element: numbers[-1] = 4
Check if 1 is in the list: 1 in numbers
Print the second value multiplied by 10: print(numbers[1] * 10)
